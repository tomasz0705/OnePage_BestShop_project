BestShop is a company that offers online store management services and provides appropriate software for this.
This website has a minimalist design and is limited to a few basic colors and fonts.
This project uses things like:
* variables,
* using the calc method,
* attaching external fonts,
* box-shadows and border-radius,
* styling forms and its non-standard elements (e.g. checkbox),
* pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes.

The Website has added responsiveness and is also configured to work with Gulp and Sass.
The BestShop mobile website design uses things like:
* environment configuration for Sass,
* dividing the project into smaller files,
* separation of variables, ```mixins``` and ```placeholders```,
* applying ```@media rules```.

This project also used:
* searching and modifying HTML elements in JavaScript,
* reacting to events,
* updating the view based on the form field values.
